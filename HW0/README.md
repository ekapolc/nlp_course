wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekapolc/nlp_course/master/HW0/mnist_keras.ipynb
```

Run the file using Jupyter. After finishing, upload the .ipynb file to courseville. (4 points)

Finally, **shut-down** the instance and take a screenshot of the console page confirming that you closed the instance. Upload the screenshot to courseville. (1 point)
